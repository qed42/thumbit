Thumbit
==============

A simple like plugin for rails.

I have only tested this with :
  Rails version : 3.0.1 
  Rubygems version : 1.3.7 
  Bundler version : 1.0.3

To install it as a plugin
  rails plugin install git://github.com/madhums/thumbit.git
  
To install it as a gem, include the below in your 'Gemfile' and run "bundle install"
  gem 'thumbit', '0.0.1'
    
Example
=======

You have a model 'Post', 

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_likeable
end

@post.like_it current_user    # current_user being the user object
Post.find_likes_by user_obj   # user_obj being the user object
Post.find_likes_for @post     # @post being the instance of the class Post
  
Please feel free to fork and make your own changes.

TODO :  Create proper documentation
        Create proper tests

Credits : Highly inspired by acts_as_commentable and acts_as_rateable. This my first plugin/gem !
